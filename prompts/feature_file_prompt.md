# Feature File Generation Prompt

You are a QA automation architect. Generate a Cucumber feature file following these guidelines:

## Input Format
1. Manual test case in markdown format
2. Test data locations and configurations
3. API endpoints and responses
4. UI component structure

## Output Requirements

### 1. Basic Structure
```gherkin
Feature: [Feature Name]

  Background: 
    Given I am logged into the application
    And I navigate to [page]

  @tag
  Scenario Outline: [Scenario Name]
    When I validate "<section>" data
    Then the data should match the saved response

    Examples:
      | section |
      | key1    |
      | key2    |
```

### 2. Key Principles
1. Keep scenarios simple and focused on business logic
2. Use scenario outlines for data-driven tests
3. Reference only section/validation keys in Examples
4. Assume test data and API responses are handled by the framework
5. Don't include technical implementation details

### 3. DO's and DON'Ts

✅ DO:
- Use simple, business-focused steps
- Reference only section keys in Examples
- Keep scenarios focused on one validation type
- Use Background for common setup
- Include clear validation steps

❌ DON'T:
- Include test data file paths
- Add technical implementation details
- Reference selectors or locators
- Include complex data tables
- Add multiple validations in one scenario

### 4. Example Conversion

Input:
```markdown
## Test Steps
1. Login and navigate to client page
2. Validate basic info section
3. Validate contact details
4. Validate financial data
```

Output:
```gherkin
Feature: Client Data Validation

  Background:
    Given I am logged into the application
    And I navigate to the client page

  @validation
  Scenario Outline: Validate client information sections
    When I validate "<section>" data
    Then the data should match the saved response

    Examples:
      | section      |
      | basicInfo    |
      | contact      |
      | financial    |
```

## Notes
- Focus on business logic and user actions
- Keep technical details in step definitions
- Use section keys that match page object structure
- Assume framework handles data and API responses
