You are a QA automation architect. Convert the following manual test case into a clean, taggable Cucumber-style `.feature` file.

Manual Test Case:
{manual_test_case}

DOM Snapshots from Multiple Pages:
{dom_snapshots}

HAR Recording:
{har_data}

Output:
- Use DOM snapshots to detect UI components, forms, buttons, conditionally rendered sections
- Use HAR to infer API intercepts and response-driven validations
- Extract page flows, user actions, and API interactions
- Sequence the steps across pages based on the order of DOM files
- For each page, infer user actions like clicking, typing, submitting, etc.
- Write a realistic, high-quality Cucumber `.feature` file  
- Use Given/When/Then for each logical step
- If UI depends on API response, include intercept/validation step
- Add meaningful tags (@form, @api, @conditional, etc.)
- Use `Feature:` and `Scenario:` blocks
- Keep the language clear and testable
